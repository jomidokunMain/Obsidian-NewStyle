“I always have a slip of paper at hand, in which I note down the ideas of certain pages. On the back, I write down the bibliographic details. After finishing the book, I go through my notes and think how these notes might be relevant for already written notes in the slip box. It means that I always read with an eye of possible connections in the slip box“ - [[Niklas Luhmann]]
